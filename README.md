**Ancestral Stories:** In many African cultures, the art of storytelling is passed
down from generation to generation. Imagine you're creating an application that
records these oral stories and translates them into different languages. The
stories vary by length, moral lessons, and the age group they are intended for.
Think about how you would model `Story`, `StoryTeller`, and `Translator`
objects, and how inheritance might come into play if there are different types of
stories or storytellers.



**African Cuisine:** You're creating a recipe app specifically for African cuisine.
The app needs to handle recipes from different African countries, each with its
unique ingredients, preparation time, cooking method, and nutritional
information. Consider creating a `Recipe` class, and think about how you might
create subclasses for different types of recipes (e.g., `MoroccanRecipe`,
`EthiopianRecipe`, `NigerianRecipe`), each with their own unique properties and
methods.
